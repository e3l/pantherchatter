# JLSChatterbox

***
INTRO
***

jlschatterbox.com is a middle school project intended to be used as a way of chatting with friends, mainly for JLS middle school, but anybody can use this. There are codes that you could enter to join private chats made by us and also other users. Accounts are optional so that you aren't constantly bugged, but it is reccomended so that you can keep the codes that you entered. This project is HTML based with javascript. We used Node.js for the chat server itself.

WHAT JLSchatterbox does
***

Jlschatter box is a website where you can chat with your friends. It has ID's, Accounts, Personal Chats, Codes, and chat for specific places, such as JLS. The accounts protect your identity and to make sure that no unwanted people can see what you tell you friends. The personal chats have a password that you custom make and tell your friends. The codes are for special things such as a JLS chat or a Connections 6th, 7th, or 8th chat.

MOTIVATION
***

We thought of doing this by thinking of problems people. We wanted to make a chatting website that didn't require making accounts and going through lots of annoying settup stuff in order to chat, only to find that your friend didn't have an account.
