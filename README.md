WHAT JLSchatterbox does
***

Jlschatter box is a website where you can chat with your friends. It has ID's, Accounts, Personal Chats, and chat for specific places, such as JLS. The accounts protect your identity and to make sure that no unwanted people can see what you tell you friends. The personal chats have a link that you can custom make and tell your friends. The codes are for special things such as a JLS chat or a Connections 6th, 7th, or 8th chat.

MOTIVATION
***

We thought of doing this by thinking of problems people. We wanted to make a chatting website that didn't require going through lots of annoying settup stuff in order to chat, only to find that your friend didn't have an account.
