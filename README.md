***
INTRO
***

JLSChatterbox.com is a middle school project intended to be used as a way of chatting with friends, mainly for JLS middle school, but anybody can use this. There are links that you could enter to join private chats made by us and also other users. This project is HTML based with javascript.

HOW TO ACCESS THE PROJECT / RUN IT
***

This project should be available at www.jlschatterbox.com


If not, there is an alternative. You can get a copy of the code, which will not be connected to the internet (For Mac Users only)!

1. Go to terminal, and type in "git clone https://github.com/e3l/pantherchatter"
2. You should get information on the repository you just cloned. Type in "ls", and make sure that one of the folders listed is "pantherchatter". Then, type in "cd pantherchatter".
3. Open a web server, then click on the "file" tab on the toolbar on top. This drops down a lot of options, click "Open file".
4. Search through your files and find "pantherchatter". Open the folder, and then double click on index.html.
5. This should've opened our project! Enjoy! :D

WHAT JLSchatterbox does
***

Jlschatter box is a website where you can chat with your friends. It has ID's, Accounts, Personal Chats, and chat for specific places, such as JLS. The accounts protect your identity and make sure that no unwanted people can see what you tell you chat about. The personal chats have a link that you can custom make and tell your friends. The codes are for special things such as a JLS chat or a Connections chat.

***
MOTIVATION
***

We thought of doing this by thinking of problems people have. We wanted to make a chatting website that didn't require going through lots of annoying settup stuff in order to chat, only to find that your friend didn't have an account.
